# Concepts-of-Data-Science-Project
This repository is for working on the Concepts of Data Science Project. The project is an implementation of a ternary search tree with an object-oriented programming approach in Python. The implemented Ternary Search Tree has full support for word insertion, word deletion, word search, tree traversal, word checking and performance benchmarking. Additionally, a comparison is made with a Binary Search Tree and a time complexity analysis is performed.
