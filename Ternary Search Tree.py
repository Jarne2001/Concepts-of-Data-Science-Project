# This Python file contains the code for the implementation of a Ternary Search Tree with an object-oriented approach.

# I suggest making 2 classes: a Ternary Search Tree Node and a Ternary Search Tree with currently 3 functions: insert, search and delete (and
# potentially also a function printing out the tree?)

class(Ternary Search Tree):
  def __init__(self, letter):
    self.letter = letter
    self.letter1 = None
