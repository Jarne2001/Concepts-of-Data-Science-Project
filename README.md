# Concepts-of-Data-Science-Project
This repository is for working on the Concepts of Data Science Project. The project is an implementation of a ternary search tree with an object-oriented programming approach in Python. The implemented Ternary Search Tree has full support for word insertion, word deletion, word search, tree traversal, word checking and performance benchmarking. Additionally, a comparison is made with a Binary Search Tree and a time complexity analysis of the insert() and search() functions is performed.

# Repository content

The repository consists of the following files:

- **Binary Tree.py**: Given Binary Search Tree implementation, needed for comparison purposes.
- **Space Complexity.py**: Python function to test for the space complexity of the current Ternary Search Tree implementation.  
- **Ternary Search Tree.py**: Actual implementation of the Ternary Search Tree.  
- **corncob_lowercase.txt**: English dictionary of 50,000 lowercase words (http://www.mieliestronk.com/corncob_lowercase.txt).  
- **insert_words-checkpoint.txt**: File containing checkpoints for the insert_words.txt file.  
- **insert_words.txt**: Given test words to test the Ternary Search Tree.  
- **job script**: Job script to run benchmarking on the HPC infrastructure.  
- **not_insert_words-checkpoint.txt**: File containing checkpoints for the not_insert_words.txt file.  
- **not_insert_words.txt**: Words not inserted into the tree, used to validate negative search cases.  
- **project_2024_2025.docx**: Project description from the Concepts of Data Science course.  
- **time_complexity_discuss**: A written discussion of expected time and space complexity.
